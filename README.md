On the frontend, we used the Dart programming language on the Flutter framework. With its help, we designed all the screens, including buttons, statistics, FAQs, etc. Additionally, the main map displayed in the app was also created using Dart and the Google API. Moreover, the push notification alerting users about a fire was also built with Flutter. Moving on to the backend, it's entirely constructed using Python on the Django framework. Its primary function was to fetch requests from FIRMS using their API. These requests include the location and information about fires in Kazakhstan over the past month, which will be used in the future to display fire locations on our frontend map. Secondary functions involve storing user data and gathering statistics on fires.
